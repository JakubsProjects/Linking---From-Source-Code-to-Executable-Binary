There are 4 files file1.c , file2.c, header.h, makefile

How to run the program:
1. type into command line: make
	-it will compile the files and give the following:
	.i, .s,.o

2. Now all the file are there and you can run the file by typing in: ./main
	-This will run the program and output hello world from each function
	as well as the value of all variables being added up as the homework asks.
	

What the program does it prints out values for each function:
Here are the equations:

-func1 and func3 should report N ( 5N + 27 )
-func2 should report 2 N ( 5N + 27 ) = N ( 10N + 54 )
-main should report 4 N ( 5N + 27 ) – 2 N = N ( 20 N + 106 )

N is the value the programmer chose to give it. N was suppose to be last digit of
persons netid + 10. The number used for this homework was 9, so 9 + 10 = 19. So N = 19.
